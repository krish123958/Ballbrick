<li>it has a feature that bricks are in numeric if the number is 2 then it has to hit the brick two time</li>
<br>

<li>it also have a demolishing features like when the user hit <strong> DE</strong> it will destroy all the bricks in entire row,if user hit DS it destroyes all the surrounding bricks </li>
<br>
<li>When the ball hits either the left or the right wall then the ball will traverse horizontally
either in right or left direction respectively. If it hits any bricks then the ball traverse
down straight to the ground level.</li>
<br>
<li>If the ball hits both wall continuously without hitting any brick then the ball is lost and
the ball has to return to its inital position (Center of the bottom most row) and the ball
count is decremented..</li>
<br>
 <li>And also the ball count is decremented if it doesn't return to the same position it
started.</li>
<br>
 <li>If all the bricks are broken before the ball count is reduced to 0 then you are the
winner or else game over.</li>
<br>
 <li>When the ball hits the top wall, the ball travels straight to the ground unless if there
are no bricks while the ball is traversing down.</li>
